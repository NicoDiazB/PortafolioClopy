As you move them, lights respond—each rhythm shaping a brightness, each pause held in glow. Your touch joins what is already becoming. Not alone, not entirely together—somewhere in between.<br /><br /> You don’t need to know how to knit. <br /> You don’t need to understand what happens. <br /> Just begin, and notice what meets you.<br /><br /> This work brings traces from an earlier participatory process—Resonant Memories—created in collaboration with Nuno Correia and Yulia Sion during a European Digital Deal residency, supported by the Creative Europe Culture programme. From those beginnings, the piece took its own path. It continued to evolve during a residency at Cittadellarte – Fondazione Pistoletto (UNIDEE), where gestures took on structure, and touch became a way of asking. <br /><br /> I move with this piece as it moves with others—holding the frame, shaping the interaction, and listening for what emerges through the hands. <br /><br /></p>",

Using punched cards as a unique medium, the project translates music into weaving patterns. This transformative process creates a system where music becomes fabric, a tangible representation of memory that can be played, seen, and experienced. Additionally, the materials, colours, and weaving process serve as metaphors for the emotional complexities of longing and loss.<br /><br /> <strong>Interwoven Traditions:</strong><br /> Beyond communication, I took the lead on key aspects of the project:<br /> By weaving together textile arts, music, and memory studies, Punching Longing explores the multifaceted nature of memory. This project navigates personal experiences alongside the stories of volunteers, fostering do-no-harm principles to create a respectful space for collective remembrance.

This journey seeks to find a more positive side to a painful past by focusing on the happiness and joy of remembrance. Unexpected narratives emerge, becoming integral parts of the author’s story and offering answers that were not initially sought.<br /><br /> <strong>Interwoven Stories:</strong><br /> The final outcome of Punching Longing consists of six textile pieces, each a unique narrative woven with a song.

      "introduction": "<p> Absent Echoes is a public installation I co-developed in response to the 2021 Colombian national strike. The work emerged from a collective need to make visible the lives lost or went presumed missing during the protests—people whose names and stories risked being silenced. Rather than focusing solely on loss, our intention was to create a space for <strong>remembrance that invites connection, continuity, and care.</strong> <br /><br /> My role in the project centred on making the <strong>tangible, textile-based elements—a </strong>material language that could hold and express the emotional weight of collective memory, while remaining open and accessible. Textiles became a way to <strong> translate grief into presence</strong> and to invite others to engage physically and symbolically with the installation. <br /><br /> </p><h3 class='text-2xl font-bold'>Material as Memory</h3> <br /> <p>At the core of the installation was a simple gesture: we invited people to handwrite the names of those who had disappeared or been killed. These names were suspended on individual threads, which together formed a web anchored to a central table. The use of thread was intentional, not decorative, but meaningful. It became a <strong>material manifestation of connection</strong>, care, and the collective act of remembering.</p><br/><p>A <strong>wicker basket filled with seeds</strong> sat at the centre of the table—an offering of life and renewal. The message we shared was: “One life taken, one life saved.” As a reminder that memory can be fertile ground for action, and that gestures of grief can also carry hope.</p> <br/> <br /><h3 class='text-2xl font-bold'>A Polyphonic Work</h3> <br /> <p>While the threads and names gave form to the installation, the piece was never about a single material or discipline. It was <strong>inherently polyphonic—made</strong> by voices, sounds, languages, and perspectives. Audio recordings mixed sounds from the Colombian protests with a shared phrase—\"Nos están matando / We are getting killed\"—repeated in Spanish, Estonian, English, and Russian. This multilingual layering reinforced the sense of transnational solidarity and made the violence harder to ignore.</p><br/><p>The piece was installed in <strong>Tallinn’s Freedom Square</strong>, a location tied to Estonia’s own struggles for independence. This setting offered a deeper resonance: a reminder that the pursuit of justice is not bounded by geography, and that shared memory can spark new forms of awareness and empathy.</p> <br /> <br /><h3 class='text-2xl font-bold'>Beyond the Square</h3> <br /><p>We also shared the installation as an <strong>audiovisual piece online</strong>, allowing its message to extend beyond its physical form. This digital extension carried the work further, connecting with people who could not be physically present but who shared its concerns.</p><br/>",

      "title": "Cangrejo",
      "subTitle": "",
      "introduction": "<strong> Cangrejo </strong> is a textile design project that reimagines children’s clothing through the lens of sustainability, material care, and freedom from gendered norms. Initially developed as part of a university research process, the graduation project was later transformed into a small-scale brand rooted in ethical practices and ecological responsibility. <br /><br /> The first collection offered playful, gender-neutral designs for children aged 2 to 4, featuring bold patterns silkscreened with non-toxic inks onto organic, certified Peruvian cotton. Every garment was conceived to support movement, curiosity, and comfort—essential aspects of early childhood exploration.",
      "information": "At its core, Cangrejo challenges the conventions of the children's fashion industry by advocating for broader colour palettes, the use of natural fibres, and the rejection of rigid gender stereotypes. The project invites reflection on how materials shape experience from an early age—not only through aesthetics, but through values. <br /> <br /> While young children may not yet verbalise their beliefs, what surrounds them—including what they wear—affects how they relate to the world. Cangrejo offers a vision of childhood grounded in softness, awareness, and the possibility of more conscious beginnings.",

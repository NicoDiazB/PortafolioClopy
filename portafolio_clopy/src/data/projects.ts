        introduction: '<strong class=" text-2xl">This project, a collaborative effort between Tallinn University and Startup Estonia, aimed to enhance the Startup Estonia website by prioritising user needs. As the PR Director, I played a critical role in fostering a productive and collaborative team environment.</strong>',

        information: `<strong>Improving Teamwork with Non-Violent Communication:</strong><br />
        Recognising the importance of clear and respectful communication, I employed non-violent communication (NVC) principles throughout the project. By focusing on empathy, active listening, and authentic expression, NVC helped us manage any communication challenges and maintain a positive collaborative spirit. This ultimately led to improved team dynamics and project efficiency.<br /><br />

        <strong>Leading Key Project Phases:</strong><br />
        Beyond communication, I took the lead on key aspects of the project:<br />
        Accessibility Evaluation: I ensured the redesigned website remained accessible for all users, adhering to  established accessibility guidelines.<br /><br />
        Interview Protocol Development: I actively participated in crafting interview questions designed to uncover the needs and aspirations of local and foreign entrepreneurs in the tech sector.<br /><br />
       Persona Creation: I facilitated the process of creating detailed user personas that accurately reflected the insights gathered through interviews. Additionally, I actively participated in the interviews themselves, both as a note-taker and interviewer.<br /><br />

        <strong>Focus on User Value:</strong><br />
        This project aimed to make the 'Why Estonia' page more attractive by prioritising user needs. My focus on communication and user persona development ensured we gathered and integrated valuable insights from entrepreneurs. This user-centric approach was crucial in creating a website experience that resonates with potential founders, ultimately attracting them to consider Estonia as their startup hub.

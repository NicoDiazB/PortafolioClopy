As the PR Director, I played a critical role in fostering a productive and collaborative team environment.</strong>',

        information: `<strong>Improving Teamwork with Non-Violent Communication:</strong><br />
        Recognising the importance of clear and respectful communication, I employed non-violent communication (NVC) principles throughout the project. By focusing on empathy, active listening, and authentic expression, NVC helped us manage any communication challenges and maintain a positive collaborative spirit. This ultimately led to improved team dynamics and project efficiency.<br /><br />

        <strong>Leading Key Project Phases:</strong><br />
        Beyond communication, I took the lead on key aspects of the project:<br />
        Accessibility Evaluation: I ensured the redesigned website remained accessible for all users, adhering to  established accessibility guidelines.<br /><br />
        Interview Protocol Development: I actively participated in crafting interview questions designed to uncover the needs and aspirations of local and foreign entrepreneurs in the tech sector.<br /><br />
       Persona Creation: I facilitated the process of creating detailed user personas that accurately reflected the insights gathered through interviews. Additionally, I actively participated in the interviews themselves, both as a note-taker and interviewer.<br /><br />

        <strong>Focus on User Value:</strong><br />
        This project aimed to make the 'Why Estonia' page more attractive by prioritising user needs. My focus on communication and user persona development ensured we gathered and integrated valuable insights from entrepreneurs. This user-centric approach was crucial in creating a website experience that resonates with potential founders, ultimately attracting them to consider Estonia as their startup hub.

        introduction: ' <strong>Punching Longing </strong> is an art project that served as my Master of Arts thesis, exploring the concept of longing through the lens of textiles and music. Set against the backdrop of Colombia’s internal conflict, this project delves into the poignant question: “What does a relative of a person presumed missing remember?”',

        information: `<strong>A Woven Journey of Memory:</strong><br />
        Punching Longing takes the form of a woven journey honouring individuals in the uncertain state of being presumed missing. Using punched cards as a unique medium, the project translates music into weaving patterns. This transformative process creates a system where music becomes fabric, a tangible representation of memory that can be played, seen, and experienced. Additionally, the materials, colours, and weaving process serve as metaphors for the emotional complexities of longing and loss.<br /><br />

        <strong>Interwoven Traditions:</strong><br />
        Beyond communication, I took the lead on key aspects of the project:<br />
        By weaving together textile arts, music, and memory studies, Punching Longing explores the multifaceted nature of memory. This project navigates personal experiences alongside the stories of volunteers, fostering do-no-harm principles to create a respectful space for collective remembrance. Through the process, weaving, music, and memory studies are mixed, and the work aims to involve volunteers respectfully.<br /><br />

        <strong>Honouring Positive Memories:</strong><br />
        Punching Longing encourages family members to remember the positive aspects of their beloved ones. This journey seeks to find a more positive side to a painful past by focusing on the happiness and joy of remembrance. Unexpected narratives emerge, becoming integral parts of the author’s story and offering answers that were not initially sought.<br /><br />

        <strong>Interwoven Stories:</strong><br />
        The final outcome of Punching Longing consists of six textile pieces, each a unique narrative woven with a song. These pieces tell a story of joy, capturing the memories and experiences of six different individuals.

        introduction: `My role in this project, part of the Estonian Academy of Arts' experimental materials subject, involved researching algae and its potential applications. Specifically, I focused on finding new uses for Baltic Sea algae. This research included a literature overview, data collection, and algae collection. While we aimed to prototype an algae-based product based on our findings, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the outcome remained entirely digital. The project also participated in the 2020 Bio-Design Challenge.<br /><br /> The project's inspiration stemmed from the changing relationship between humans and food. We investigated how food technology has influenced our development and envisioned a future where food serves primarily for pleasure, with essential nutrition coming from alternative sources.`,
        imageInformation:"/projects/human-computer-interaction/power-a/image-powerA.webp",
        information: `The research focused on symbiotic relationships in nature, particularly lichens, which combine fungus and algae for survival. This exploration led us to consider whether algae could provide nutrients directly through human skin. Jewellery was considered a potential platform for delivering these nutrients in the future.<br /><br />

        The project's vision is to develop an algae-based transdermal patch that delivers essential nutrients, freeing humans from the routine of eating for basic needs. This approach could also contribute to reducing food waste and environmental impact.<br /><br />
        Overall, the project explored the potential of algae as a future food source and applied bio-design principles in product development. Through my role, I gained valuable experience in research and speculative design.

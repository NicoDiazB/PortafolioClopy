        introduction: `
        Where does a gesture go once it’s made? <br />
        A thread cast forward. A light that answers.
        Needles touch, and something shifts—quietly, rhythmically.
        `,
        information:`
        This piece began among stories shared in motion—knitting beside older generations in Serbia, where hands moved as much as voices. Some stitches carried memory, others simply held the moment. What stayed was the feeling of something passed on, not in words, but in gestures that returned. <br /><br />
        Now, this act continues. <br />
        Four pairs of connected needles rest before you. As you move them, lights respond—each rhythm shaping a brightness, each pause held in glow. Your touch joins what is already becoming.
        Not alone, not entirely together—somewhere in between.<br /><br />
        You don’t need to know how to knit. <br />
        You don’t need to understand what happens. <br />
        Just begin, and notice what meets you.<br /><br />

        This work brings traces from an earlier participatory process—Resonant Memories—created in collaboration with Nuno Correia and Yulia Sion during a European Digital Deal residency, supported by the Creative Europe Culture programme. From those beginnings, the piece took its own path. It continued to evolve during a residency at Cittadellarte – Fondazione Pistoletto (UNIDEE), where gestures took on structure, and touch became a way of asking. <br /><br />

        I move with this piece as it moves with others—holding the frame, shaping the interaction, and listening for what emerges through the hands. <br /><br />

        My involvement focused on the participatory dimension of the work, including the facilitation of four textile-based workshops with over 30 participants.

        information: `<strong>A Woven Journey of Memory:</strong><br />
        Punching Longing takes the form of a woven journey honouring individuals in the uncertain state of being presumed missing. Using punched cards as a unique medium, the project translates music into weaving patterns. This transformative process creates a system where music becomes fabric, a tangible representation of memory that can be played, seen, and experienced. Additionally, the materials, colours, and weaving process serve as metaphors for the emotional complexities of longing and loss.<br /><br />

        <strong>Interwoven Traditions:</strong><br />
        Beyond communication, I took the lead on key aspects of the project:<br />
        By weaving together textile arts, music, and memory studies, Punching Longing explores the multifaceted nature of memory. This project navigates personal experiences alongside the stories of volunteers, fostering do-no-harm principles to create a respectful space for collective remembrance. Through the process, weaving, music, and memory studies are mixed, and the work aims to involve volunteers respectfully.<br /><br />

        <strong>Honouring Positive Memories:</strong><br />
        Punching Longing encourages family members to remember the positive aspects of their beloved ones. This journey seeks to find a more positive side to a painful past by focusing on the happiness and joy of remembrance. Unexpected narratives emerge, becoming integral parts of the author’s story and offering answers that were not initially sought.<br /><br />

        <strong>Interwoven Stories:</strong><br />
        The final outcome of Punching Longing consists of six textile pieces, each a unique narrative woven with a song. These pieces tell a story of joy, capturing the memories and experiences of six different individuals.

        cover: "/projects/human-computer-interaction/absent-echoes/cover-absent-echoes.webp",

        introduction: `<p> Absent Echoes is a public installation I co-developed in response to the 2021 Colombian national strike. The work emerged from a collective need to make visible the lives lost or went presumed missing during the protests—people whose names and stories risked being silenced. Rather than focusing solely on loss, our intention was to create a space for <strong>remembrance that invites connection, continuity, and care.</strong> <br /><br />
        My role in the project centred on making the <strong>tangible, textile-based elements—a </strong>material language that could hold and express the emotional weight of collective memory, while remaining open and accessible. Textiles became a way to <strong> translate grief into presence</strong> and to invite others to engage physically and symbolically with the installation. <br /><br /> </p>
        
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Material as Memory</h3> <br /> <p>At the core of the installation was a simple gesture: we invited people to handwrite the names of those who had disappeared or been killed. These names were suspended on individual threads, which together formed a web anchored to a central table. The use of thread was intentional, not decorative, but meaningful. It became a <strong>material manifestation of connection</strong>, care, and the collective act of remembering.
        </p><br/>
        <p>A <strong>wicker basket filled with seeds</strong> sat at the centre of the table—an offering of life and renewal. The message we shared was: “One life taken, one life saved.” As a reminder that memory can be fertile ground for action, and that gestures of grief can also carry hope.</p> <br/> <br />

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">A Polyphonic Work</h3> <br /> <p>While the threads and names gave form to the installation, the piece was never about a single material or discipline. It was <strong>inherently polyphonic—made</strong> by voices, sounds, languages, and perspectives. Audio recordings mixed sounds from the Colombian protests with a shared phrase—"Nos están matando / We are getting killed"—repeated in Spanish, Estonian, English, and Russian. This multilingual layering reinforced the sense of transnational solidarity and made the violence harder to ignore.</p><br/>
        <p>The piece was installed in <strong>Tallinn’s Freedom Square</strong>, a location tied to Estonia’s own struggles for independence. This setting offered a deeper resonance: a reminder that the pursuit of justice is not bounded by geography, and that shared memory can spark new forms of awareness and empathy.</p> <br /> <br />

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Beyond the Square</h3> <br />
        <p>We also shared the installation as an <strong>audiovisual piece online</strong >, allowing its message to extend beyond its physical form. This digital extension carried the work further, connecting with people who could not be physically present but who shared its concerns.</p><br/>

        The project's vision is to develop an algae-based transdermal patch that delivers essential nutrients, freeing humans from the routine of eating for basic needs. This approach could also contribute to reducing food waste and environmental impact.<br /><br />
        Overall, the project explored the potential of algae as a future food source and applied bio-design principles in product development. Through my role, I gained valuable experience in research and speculative design.

        introduction: `A social and User-Centred Design project was a collaborative effort with Merimetsa Keskus and the Estonian Academy of Arts (EKA), focusing on developing creative solutions with people with special needs. <br /> Initially, the plan was to co-create directly with the participants, but the COVID-19 pandemic required the project to shift to a practitioner-led proposal. The guiding philosophy of this project was <strong>  “Nobody is perfect. It is what makes us unique and beautiful” </strong> which informed the inclusive and empowering design approach.`,

        otherimfortmation: `<strong>Project Goals:</strong><br /><br />
        <strong>Technique:</strong> Develop a practical method for creating personalised artefacts.<br /><br />
        <strong>Identity:</strong> Enable participants to express their unique identities through their creations.<br /><br />
        <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Ensure the process is efficient and manageable for people with special needs.<br /><br />
        <strong>Market Appeal:</strong> Design the product visually appealing and engaging to a broader audience.<br /><br />
        <strong>Process</strong><br /><br />

        <strong>Initial Site Visit:</strong><br /> <br /> I visited Merimetsa Keskus to understand the environment and gather insights into the needs and capabilities of the participants. This visit was crucial in informing the design process, as further direct engagement was impossible due to the pandemic.<br /><br />
        <strong>Developing the Proposal:</strong><br /> <br /> Based on the initial visit and understanding the participants’ needs, I developed a proposal to create personalised slip-casting moulds. This technique allows each person to customise their artefacts with pieces and colours, making the process accessible and meaningful.<br /><br />
        The design ensured the process was easy to reproduce, allowing participants to create and customise their clay artefacts independently.<br /><br />
        <strong>Outcome:</strong><br /> <br /> The final proposal featured clay and personal artefacts that were easy to customise and reproduce. Each artefact could be uniquely personalised using slip-casting moulds, allowing participants to apply their own pieces and colours. This approach supported the goals of technique, identity, and productivity, empowering participants to express their individuality through their creations.<br /><br />
        <strong>Presentation:</strong><br /> <br /> The project concluded with a detailed proposal outlining the process for implementing the personalised clay artefacts, emphasising user-centred design and market appeal.<br /><br />

        introduction: `The Dream Weaver's Workshop project explored how to create a fun and creative space for kids. <br /> <br /> Originally planned as an in-person activity, it shifted online due to COVID-19. Over 16 weeks, I led this project, working with children who attended Vivistop's creative space online and in person (when safe) to learn about their hopes and ideas for this space. This project focused on developing a proposal for a space initially intended to be conducted in person, but the process shifted to online to ensure safety and continuity. Over 16 weeks, I facilitated this solo project, working closely with children both in person and online to understand their needs and aspirations for the Vivistop space. <br /><br />
        The outcome of this project was the mix of a praxinoscope and a music box, transforming the space into an entertaining yet creative environment. The final work was presented via Zoom, ensuring the project remained connected and collaborative.
